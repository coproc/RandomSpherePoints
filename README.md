# RandomSpherePoints
Python code for getting uniformly distributed points on or inside a sphere

```python
from randomSpherePoints import randomPointOnSphere
x,y,z = randomPointOnSphere()
# p = (x,y,z) is uniformly distributed on the surface of the unit sphere

from randomSpherePoints import randomPointInsideSphere
x,y,z = randomPointInsideSphere()
# p = (x,y,z) is uniformly distributed inside the unit sphere
```
